Question #1: Website Creation
I created a property listing website called Chelstone House Sales.
The website allows users to view houses for sale in Lusaka, see house images, check Google Maps locations, and contact sellers indirectly through a form.
The website contains over #27 HTML elements and more than #27 HTML attributes.
Semantic HTML elements were used to properly organize the content and improve readability and accessibility.
Question #2: HTML Elements
#1. Most Challenging Elements
Form – It was challenging because it required multiple input fields, labels, and validation attributes.
Article – Understanding how to use it for individual house listings took time.
Image (img) – Adding correct image attributes such as alt, src, and loading was challenging.
Section – Dividing content into logical sections required careful planning.
Anchor (a) – Linking houses to Google Maps correctly needed attention.
#2. Semantic Elements Usage
Header was used for the website title and navigation menu.
Section was used to divide the website into house listings and contact areas.
Article was used to display individual house details.
Footer was used for copyright information and location details.
#3. Most Useful Element
The Section element was the most useful because it helped organize the website into clear parts such as house listings and buyer–seller communication.
Question #3: HTML Attributes
#1. Essential Attributes
href – Used to link house locations to Google Maps.
src – Used to load images of houses.
required – Used to ensure form fields are filled before submission.
#2. Class vs ID
ID was used for unique sections such as navigation targets.
Class was used to style and group multiple house listings.
#3. Best Attribute for User Experience
The placeholder attribute improved user experience by guiding users on what information to enter in the contact form.
Question #4: Development Process
#1. Planning
I first planned the website structure by identifying sections such as home, available houses, locations, and contact form.
#2. Testing
I tested the website by opening it in a browser, clicking Google Maps links, checking image loading, and submitting the contact form.
#3. Challenges
I struggled with organizing house listings and linking Google Maps correctly, but I solved these challenges by testing and reviewing HTML documentation.
Question #5: Git & GitHub Implementation
#1. Git Commands Used
Copy code

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main
#2. Commit Strategy
I made commits after completing major sections such as house listings, Google Maps integration, and the contact form.
#3. Importance of Version Control
Version control helps track changes, prevents loss of work, and allows future improvements and collaboration.
Question #6: Code Quality
#1. Validation
I ensured the HTML code was valid by testing it in a web browser and checking for syntax errors.
#2. Best Practices
Proper indentation
Use of semantic HTML elements
Clear and meaningful class and ID names
#3. Improvements
The code can be improved by:
Separating CSS into an external stylesheet
Improving accessibility with better alt text
Optimizing images for faster loading
Adding more form validation
Embedding Google Maps using iframe
